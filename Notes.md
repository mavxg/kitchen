# TODO

[x] Adjust mortice tolerance on cubby
[x] Check depths on uppers
[x] Decide on 9 or 18 mm back on cabinet 2 (layout drawer bottoms)

[ ] Layout drawer boxes (probably need 1 sheet of 9mm and 2 sheets fo 12mm)
 -- We have some other stuff to cut out of 9 mm so if we have space on the 9mm
    we should make the cabinet 2 back  out of 9 mm.

[x] Reconsider shelf pins

[x] Check under boiler boxing

[ ] Change drawer unit widths as cabinet is 720 wide (not 700)

[X] Get rid of filler strip on cab 12 (check door handle clearence first)

[ ] Optional end panel for cab 16

??? Do we want to adjust the end cabinet for no filler strip?

[ ] Check all the gaps on the fronts


## Plywood

### Wholesale price approx (ex.VAT)

24mm ~ £145
18mm ~ £115
12mm ~ £100
9mm ~ £70

### Weight per area

4mm =2.7 kg/m2
6mm =4.4 kg/m2
9mm =6.3 kg/m2
12mm =8.2 kg/m2
15mm =10.1 kg/m2
18mm =12.0 kg/m2
21mm =13.9 kg/m2
24mm =15.9 kg/m2
27mm =18.0 kg/m2
30mm =20.0 kg/m2
35mm =23.8 kg/m2
40mm =26.3 kg/m2
45mm =29.6 kg/m2
50mm =33.7 kg/m2


## Thickness (standard birch)

Ranges from 4mm @ +0.3mm/-0.4mm to 50mm @ ±1.2mm

24mm is approx 23.6mm
18mm is approx 17.7mm
15mm is approx 15mm
12mm is approx 11.7mm
9mm is approx 9mm

Add 0.3mm tolerance if using 9mm or 15mm.


### Blanco Under Sink Bin

Bin 456 tall. (including Olga drawer)

IMPORTANT: Internal width must be 562 or 568. This is not a range.

## Blum

### Soft close door hinges

4-6 kg 2 hinges (750 x 600)
6-12kg 3 hinges (1500 x 600)
12-17kg 4 hinges (2100 x 600)
17-22kg 5 hinges (2400 x 600)


## CNC  Projects (CAD)

Rhino 7 -- this is the CAD tool they use. 

-- IGES seems to be a nice format to use

### 2D File (Ideally by layer and colour)

RED OUTLINE
BLUE INLINE
GREEN - 4MM THROUGH HOLES

WHITE - V ENGRAVING 1MM DEEP

Panel Cut

Notes for future CAD work. Do not put dogbones on the modelled parts. Add them afterwards when making the CAM stuff. It might be that you don't want them at all.

This would save a huge amount of time in modelling (and filesize.) You can add the tolerances at this stage also.


If you can use an 8MM cutter on 18MM material it can run in 2/3s the time since it needs fewer passes.


# Phase 1 costs

5 Sheets of 18mm Birch Ply bb/bb £560.40
1 Sheet of 24mm Birch Ply bb/bb £154.50
Programming £120
CNC Machining of Parts £300
Sheet Waste Recycling £9
Delivery to SE3 £73.80

# Finishing

## OSMO

80 cross grain (if scratched)
80 with grain (same pad)

120 with grain
180 with grains
(Don't go more than 240 because it stops the oil soaking in.)

Stir thoroughly.
Apply OSMO thin with white scouring pad -- or it goes sticky
Use another pad to wipe to a very thin coat.

## Paint



# Joining

3.5 x 40 screws for drawers
4x50 screws for 18mm edge

Why is the performance of the TechDraw and Shape 2D View functions so slow? How do you design a nice interface for that sort of thing when you consider visability?
